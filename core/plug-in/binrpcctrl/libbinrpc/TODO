[ ] add v1 compatibility
[*] optimize int repr (negatives).
[ ] add speedup code (vs minimal size) (regarding packing to wire)
[ ] add (TLS) object cache for call contexts, call values, cb's req/rpl_cb_t,
	dissectors
[ ] deal with (.,*) for req cb registrations in case of name colision
[ ] increase req:rpl metching reliabilty (increase CL field (cookie len) by 1
    bits from flags (FLAGS fld))
[ ] parse only header|parse values
[ ] fix hdr definition: lenght (&cookie?) always 4 bytes (save 1 syscall)
[ ] floating point support
[ ] reentrant call disassambling|scanning (scanning context, value scanning)
[ ] lazier parsing (if needed) [flags for mname|body parse status]
[ ] don't deallocate raw buffer
[ ] check protocol version when receving
[ ] if not reentrant, use static recv buffers
[ ] seq val add with same sign. as bprc_asm

Proto notes:
- no struct terminator
- AVPs can be identified by integers
- flags used to discriminate among call type
- request error response (code/reason)
- only accept power of 2 as int size representation, with max exp 3 (but:)
- integer means signed 32 bits
- requests have a STR first record
- replies can contain multiple (top level) values.
